# AssetOpsBench Setup Guide

This guide describes how to fork, configure, and run the **AssetOpsBench** project using Conda and Docker on macOS.

---

## Fork to Your Own Project

This guide shows how to create your own copy of the **IBM/AssetOpsBench** project on GitHub, using only the web browser.  
A fork lets you experiment and make changes without affecting the original project.

---

### Step 1 — Log in to GitHub
1. Open [https://github.com](https://github.com) in your browser.  
2. Sign in with your GitHub account.  
   - If you don’t have one, click **Sign up** to create a free account.

---

### Step 2 — Navigate to the Original Repository
1. In the search bar at the top of GitHub, type **IBM/AssetOpsBench**.  
2. Click on the repository link, or go directly to:  
   👉 [https://github.com/IBM/AssetOpsBench](https://github.com/IBM/AssetOpsBench)

---

### Step 3 — Required Branch for This Work
The repository contains multiple branches, but for this purpose you will only use:

- **`Competition_CODS`** → this branch contains the competition-specific code and materials.  

👉 You still need to fork with **all branches** available so you can access `Competition_CODS`.

---

### Step 4 — Create the Fork
1. On the top-right of the page, click the **Fork** button.  
   ![fork-button](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-30686/images/help/repository/fork_button.png)  

2. On the fork setup page:  
   - Make sure your own GitHub account is selected as the destination.  
   - **Important:** Uncheck the option **“Copy the `main` branch only.”**  
     - Leaving it checked will copy only `main`.  
     - Unchecking ensures you also get **`Competition_CODS`** and other branches.  

3. Click **Create fork**.

---

### Step 5 — Switch to the `Competition_CODS` Branch
1. Go to your forked repository:  
   👉 `https://github.com/<your-username>/AssetOpsBench`

2. Open the **Branch dropdown menu** (upper-left, just above the file list).  
   ![branch-dropdown](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-33248/images/help/branch/branch-dropdown.png)

3. Select **`Competition_CODS`** from the list.  
   - This switches your forked repository view to the competition branch.  

---

### Step 6 — Verify Your Fork
- After switching, confirm that the branch name `Competition_CODS` is shown at the top-left of the repository.  
- All further work for the competition should be done in this branch.

---

### Important Notes
- Always uncheck **“Copy the `main` branch only”** when forking. Otherwise you won’t see `Competition_CODS`.  
- Even though other branches are copied, you only need to use **`Competition_CODS`** for this competition.


## 2. Clone to Your Local Machine (Using GitHub Desktop)

Once you have forked the repository on GitHub, you may want to work with it locally on your computer.  
Here we use **GitHub Desktop** to illustrate the process.

---

### Step 1 — Install GitHub Desktop
1. Download GitHub Desktop from: https://desktop.github.com  
2. Install and open the application.  
3. Sign in with your GitHub account.

---

### Step 2 — Locate Your Fork
1. In your browser, go to your forked repository:  
   `https://github.com/<your-username>/AssetOpsBench`
2. Click the green **Code** button.  
3. Select **Open with GitHub Desktop**.  
   - This will launch GitHub Desktop and prepare to clone your fork.

---

### Step 3 — Choose the Local Path
1. In GitHub Desktop, choose where to save the project locally.  
2. Set the path to:
	local path:  <your_local_directory>/codabench/AssetOpsBench
	

### Step 4 — Switch to the `Competition_CODS` Branch
⚠️ For this competition, you must work **only** on the `Competition_CODS` branch.

1. In GitHub Desktop, use the **Current Branch** dropdown (top bar).  
2. Select `Competition_CODS` from the list.  
   - If you don’t see it, ensure you unchecked “Copy the main branch only” when you forked.

---

### Step 5 — Verify
1. The branch name shown at the top of GitHub Desktop should be **Competition_CODS**.  
2. Confirm the file view matches the content of this branch.

---

✅ You have successfully cloned your fork locally with GitHub Desktop and switched to the **`Competition_CODS`** branch. All further work should be done in this branch.




## 3. Docker Setup (Rancher Desktop)

We use **Rancher Desktop** for the Docker CLI and engine. Install it from [https://rancherdesktop.io](https://rancherdesktop.io).

### 3.1 Install & Configure
1. Open **Rancher Desktop** → **Preferences**.  
2. Go to **Virtual Machine → Emulation**:  
   - **Virtual Machine Type**:  
     - `VZ` (recommended on Apple Silicon) → uses the Apple Virtualization framework.  
     - `QEMU` → software emulator (slower, only if VZ is unavailable).  
   - **VZ Option**: enable **Rosetta support** to run amd64 (x86) Docker images on Apple Silicon.  
3. Click **Apply**. Rancher Desktop will restart with the new settings.

### 3.2 (Optional) Verify the Docker CLI
You can check that the `docker` command is coming from Rancher Desktop.

```bash
which docker
docker version
```

**Expected path (example):**
```
~/.rd/bin/docker
```

- On macOS this expands to `/Users/<your-username>/.rd/bin/docker`.  
- On Linux it expands to `/home/<your-username>/.rd/bin/docker`.  

If you see `/usr/local/bin/docker`, another Docker runtime (e.g., Docker Desktop) is active. Quit it and ensure Rancher Desktop is running.

### 3.3 (If Kubernetes is On) Ensure Certificates Are Fresh
If you enable Kubernetes in Rancher Desktop, its certificates can expire and block startup.

**Quick checks:**
```bash
kubectl version --short
kubectl get nodes
kubectl cluster-info
```

**If errors mention expired or invalid certificates:**
- In Rancher Desktop: go to **Preferences → Kubernetes → Reset Kubernetes** (regenerates certificates).  
- If problems persist: use **Preferences → Troubleshooting → Factory Reset** (removes images/containers and resets certificates).

## 4. Build and Run


### Pre-built Docker Images
We provide two base Docker images `quay.io/assetopsbench/assetopsbench-basic` and `quay.io/assetopsbench/assetopsbench-extra` which serves as the AssetOpsBench environment. The base images provide
- `quay.io/assetopsbench/assetopsbench-basic`: A minimal Python 3.12 environment with only essential Python packages installed. Suitable for lightweight benchmarking tasks or custom setup.
- `quay.io/assetopsbench/assetopsbench-extra`: A full-featured Python 3.12 environment with all components pre-installed, including Individual agents (e.g., IoT Agent), MetaAgent, and AgentHive.

The python environment in both docker images use Conda to manage. The name of pre-built Conda environment is `assetopsbench`. For full list of installed packages, please refer to [basic_requirements.txt](https://github.com/IBM/AssetOpsBench/blob/main/benchmark/basic_requirements.txt) and [extra_requirements.txt](https://github.com/IBM/AssetOpsBench/blob/main/benchmark/extra_requirements.txt).

### CouchDB Setup

To streamline access to asset data during benchmarking, we use a Dockerized CouchDB instance. This setup allows for easy loading, querying, and management of benchmark datasets within a consistent environment.

A sample [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/IBM/AssetOpsBench/blob/main/benchmark/docker-compose.yml) is provided to help you start CouchDB locally with default configuration and credentials. We use [couchdb_setup.sh](https://github.com/IBM/AssetOpsBench/blob/main/benchmark/couchdb_setup.sh) as starting command to create a CouchDB database populating with a [sample Chiller dataset](https://github.com/IBM/AssetOpsBench/blob/main/src/assetopsbench/sample_data/chiller6_june2020_sensordata_couchdb.csv).


### Run Benchmark Script
In [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/IBM/AssetOpsBench/blob/main/benchmark/docker-compose.yml), we mount the benchmark scripts ([entrypoint.sh](https://github.com/IBM/AssetOpsBench/blob/main/benchmark/entrypoint.sh) and [run_plan_execute.py](https://github.com/IBM/AssetOpsBench/blob/main/benchmark/run_plan_execute.py) and scenario files as volumes to assetopsbench container.

Now we run the following command,

```commandline
cd /path/to/AssetOpsBench
chmod +x benchmark/cods_track1/entrypoint.sh
docker-compose -f benchmark/docker-compose.yml up
```

You can use [.env](https://github.com/IBM/AssetOpsBench/blob/main/benchmark/.env) or add your environment variables to `.env` which can be passed to containers through `docker-compose.yml`.

 Note that in `entrypoint.sh`, we activate the python environment by `conda activate assetopsbench` first.

### Local Testing for a Specific Utterance ID:

Once the environment varibales are added to .env file, go to “entrypoint.sh”, and add the utterance ids you want to test for in the following line.

```commandline

python /home/run_track_1.py --utterance_ids <id_no>
```

Please make sure you are adding more than one utterance_id then they are separated by “,”. Also provide one id at a time for fast response. Now, we run: 

```commandline
chmod +x benchmark/cods_track1/entrypoint.sh
docker-compose -f benchmark/docker-compose.yml up
```
You should be seeing the responses in a minute in the terminal. 

### Testing Your modified Submission File:

You can only see whether your modified submission file is compiling or not and producing responsed or not. You can not generate evalution scores locally. Those will be generated once you submit the submission file to codabench platform. Usually you should be able to see the evaluation results of your script after 18-24 Hrs from submission. Participant has to download the file named “track1_planning.py” from the codabench competition page, modify the content and then need to move the file the “cods_track1” folder in your local machine and rename it as run_track_1.py(Basically replacing existing “run_track_1.py”) with the modified version. If we want to change or test for specific utterance ids, we can follow the same procedure as given above in "Local Testing for a Specific Utterance ID". Once the modifications are completed, We run:

```commandline
chmod +x benchmark/cods_track1/entrypoint.sh
docker-compose -f benchmark/docker-compose.yml up
```
